# knacksync
KnackSync is an open-source library that, when imported at runtime via Knack's client-side JavaScript, allows you to sync data between Knack views and IndexedDB, keeping data local-first in cases of offline access and quick reads/writes from custom components while maintaining record-level eventual consistency with your Knack database.
